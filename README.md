# Text-Classification
A project on text classification by using various ML models and concluding which model is best based on accuracy. 

#Data Sets
20newsgroup Data has been used from scipy and various machine learning models like Multinomial Naive Bayes, Decision Tree Classifier has been used to find which Machine Learning model is most suitable for the Text Classification.

# Hardcoding of Naive Bayes has been done.

#Conclusion 

After applying various model it was concluded that Multinomial Naive Bayes is the best algorithm for the Text Classification as it shows highest accuracy.
