# Text-Classification
The project focuses on developing a robust text classification system using machine learning techniques to categorize large volumes of unstructured text data into predefined topics or classes. The goal is to automate the process of assigning relevant categories to text documents, making it more efficient for information retrieval and organization.

**Data Collection:** Gather a diverse dataset containing text documents across various topics. The dataset should be representative of the target categories and include both training and testing sets.

**Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the text data to remove noise, irrelevant information, and standardize the format. Techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization are applied to create a consistent representation of the text.

**Feature Extraction:** Convert the preprocessed text into numerical features that can be used as input for machine learning models. Common techniques include TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings like Word2Vec or GloVe.

**Model Selection:** Choose appropriate machine learning models for text classification. Common models include Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).

**Training:** Train the selected model using the labeled training dataset. The model learns patterns and relationships between the input features and corresponding categories during this phase.

**Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance on a separate testing dataset to assess its accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Fine-tune the model and parameters based on evaluation results.

**Deployment:** Integrate the trained model into an application or system that requires automated text classification. This can involve developing APIs or incorporating the model into a web-based platform.

**Continuous Improvement:** Implement mechanisms for continuous model improvement. Periodically retrain the model with new data to adapt to evolving language patterns and ensure sustained accuracy over time.
